# LowPolyTerrain
Low Poly Terrain in Game Maker Studio 2

All main settings stored in macros script

On my PC it runs about 1500-2000 fps_real and smooth 60 fps

I dont recommend to set WORLD_SIZE near to 1000, it will generate terrain very slowly but you can try it out.

Dont use my implementation of DoF, cause it have some bugs and its bad...

Functions:

1. Low poly terrain generation

2. Low poly water

3. Horizon Based Ambient Occlusion (HBAO)

4. HBAO's Blur Pass

5. Bokeh, Blur, DoF shaders

6. Skybox

7. Simple lightning

8. Simplex / Perlin noises
